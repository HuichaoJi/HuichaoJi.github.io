    <p> Hi! I'm a graduate student in Department of Psychology at Sun Yat-Sen University. I work with <a href="http://psy.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/719">Xiaowei Ding</a>. 
        Before working with Dr.Ding, I did my <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02205">undergraduate work</a> with <a href="http://psy.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/307">Jing Samantha Pan</a> in the <a href="https://palab-cn.github.io">Perception & Action Laboratory</a>.</p>
    
    <p>My research mainly includes the following:<br/>  
       (1) The processing biological motion. <br/>
       (2) How intelligent is working memory. <br/> 
       (3) The interaction between attention and working memory. <br/></p>
    
    <p>I also work with other researchers to study the attention characteristics of special crowd, for example, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/16066359.2019.1708905">methamphetamine users</a>. </p>
    <p></p>
