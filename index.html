    <p> Hi, I'm Huichao Ji (冀慧超), a postgraduate student (Master's degree expected in June 2022) in Department of Psychology at Sun Yat-sen University. I work with <a href="http://psy.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/719" target="_blank">Dr. Xiaowei Ding</a>. 
        Before working with Dr. Ding, I did my <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02205" target="_blank">undergraduate work</a> with <a href="http://psy.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/307" target="_blank">Dr. Jing Samantha Pan</a> in the <a href="https://palab-cn.github.io" target="_blank">Perception & Action Laboratory</a>.</p>
    <p>We live in a social world with a highly intelligent cognitive system. I'm interested in how does human mind use capacity-limited cognitive systems to process unlimited information in the world by focusing on perception, attention, and working memory.
       For social information processing, we have investigated how do we perceive (Ji & Pan, 2019; Shao et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2021) and attend (Ji et al., 2020) to 
       others' actions and social interactions. </p>
    <p>Currently, I'm working on some more fundamental aspects of cognition including the following:<br>
    (1) What is the manipulation unit of visual working memory?</br>
    (2) How does our memory system dispose of information with different priorities? </br>
    (3) How do we use memory to guide attention in a world full of uncertainty? </br>
    </br> </p>
